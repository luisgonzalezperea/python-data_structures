## 🧐 Purpose <a name = "purpose"></a>
The objective of implementing the main data structures in Python is to know how to select the most appropriate one to solve a problem, taking into account complexity, storage needs and performance. In addition, I was introduced to the logic of programming.

## 🖇 Repository content <a name="repository_content"></a>
I have added the implementation of some of the most used data structures, as well as some tests to check that the implementation was correct. In order to go deeper into this topic, I have solved some problems with these structures.
